Toil
====

Features
--------

Toil is a workflow engine entirely written in Python. It features:

* Easy installation, e.g. ``pip install toil``.

* A small API 
  
  Easily mastered, the user API is built upon one core class.

* Cross platform support 
  
  Develop and test on your laptop then deploy on any of the following:
  
  - Commercial clouds
    + `Amazon Web Services`_ (including the `spot market`_)
    + `Microsoft Azure`_
  - Private clouds
    + `OpenStack`_
  - High Performance Computing Environments
    + `GridEngine`_
    + `Apache Mesos`_
    + `Parasol`_
    + Individual multi-core machines
       
* Complete file and stream management:
   
  Temporary and persistent file management that abstracts the details of the
  underlying file system, providing a uniform interface regardless of
  environment. Supports both atomic file transfer and streaming interfaces, and
  provides encryption of user data.
   
* Scalability:

  Toil can easily handle workflows concurrently using hundreds of nodes and
  thousands of cores.

* Robustness:

  Toil workflows support arbitrary worker and leader failure, with strong
  check-pointing that always allows resumption.

* Efficiency:

  Caching, fine grained, per task, resource requirement specifications, and
  support for the AWS spot market mean workflows can be executed with little
  waste.

* Declarative and dynamic workflow creation:

  Workflows can be declared statically, but new jobs can be added dynamically
  during execution within any existing job, allowing arbitrarily complex
  workflow graphs with millions of jobs within them.

* Support for databases and services:

  For example, Apache Spark clusters can be created in seconds and easily
  integrated within a toil workflow as a service, with precisely defined time
  start and end times that fits with the flow of other jobs in the workflow.

* Draft Common Workflow Language (CWL) support
  
  Complete support for the draft 2.0 CWL specification, allowing it to execute
  CWL workflows.

* Open Source: An Apache license allows unrestricted use.

Installation
------------

To setup a basic Toil installation use

::
    
    pip install toil

Toil uses setuptools' extras_ mechanism for dependencies of optional features
like support for Mesos or AWS. To install Toil with all bells and whistles use

::

   pip install toil[aws,mesos,azure,encryption]

.. _extras: https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies

Here's what each extra provides:

* The ``aws`` extra provides support for storing workflow state in Amazon AWS.
  This extra has no native dependencies.

* The ``azure`` extra stores workflow state in Microsoft Azure Storage. This
  extra has no native dependencies.

* The ``mesos`` extra provides support for running Toil on an `Apache Mesos`_
  cluster. Note that running Toil on SGE (GridEngine), Parasol or a single
  machine does not require an extra. The ``mesos`` extra requires the following
  native dependencies:

  * :ref:`Apache Mesos <mesos>`
  * :ref:`Python headers and static libraries <python-dev>`

* The ``encryption`` extra provides client-side encryption for files stored in
  the Azure and AWS job stores. This extra requires the following native
  dependencies:
  
  * :ref:`Python headers and static libraries <python-dev>`
  * :ref:`Libffi headers and library <libffi-dev>`
  
.. _mesos:
.. topic:: Apache Mesos

   Only needed for the ``mesos`` extra. Toil has been tested with version
   0.25.0. Mesos can be installed on Linux by following the instructions on
   https://open.mesosphere.com/getting-started/install/. The `Homebrew`_
   package manager has a formula for Mesos such that running ``brew install
   mesos`` is probably the easiest way to install Mesos on OS X. This assumes,
   of course, that you already have `Xcode`_ and `Homebrew`_.

   Please note that even though Toil depends on the Python bindings for Mesos,
   it does not explicitly declare that dependency and they will **not** be
   installed automatically when you run ``pip install toil[mesos]``. You need
   to install the bindings manually. The `Homebrew`_ formula for OS X installs
   them by default. On Ubuntu you will need to download the appropriate .egg
   from https://open.mesosphere.com/downloads/mesos/ and install it using
   ``easy_install -a <path_to_egg>``. Note that on Ubuntu Trusty you may need
   to upgrade ``protobuf`` via ``pip install --upgrade protobuf`` **before**
   running the above ``easy_install`` command.

.. _python-dev:
.. topic:: Python headers and static libraries

   Only needed for the ``mesos`` and ``encryption`` extras. The Python headers
   and static libraries can be installed on Ubuntu/Debian by running ``sudo
   apt-get install build-essential python-dev`` and accordingly on other Linux
   distributions. On Mac OS X, these headers and libraries are installed when
   you install the `Xcode`_ command line tools by running ``xcode-select
   --install``, assuming, again, that you have `Xcode`_ installed.

.. _libffi-dev:
.. topic:: Libffi headers and library

   `Libffi`_ is only needed for the ``encryption`` extra. To install `Libffi`_
   on Ubuntu, run ``sudo apt-get install libffi-dev``. On Mac OS X, run ``brew
   install libffi``. This assumes, of course, that you have `Xcode`_ and
   `Homebrew`_ installed.

Scripting Quick Start
---------------------

Toil's Job class (:class:`toil.job.Job`) contains the Toil API, documented below.
To begin, consider this short toil script which illustrates defining a workflow::

    from toil.job import Job
         
    def helloWorld(message, memory="2G", cores=2, disk="3G"):
        return "Hello, world!, here's a message: %s" % message
            
    j = Job.wrapFn(helloWorld, "woot")
               
    if __name__=="__main__":
        options = Job.Runner.getDefaultOptions("./toilWorkflow")
        print Job.Runner.startToil(j, options) #Prints Hello, world!, ...

The workflow consists of a single job, which calls the helloWorld function. The resource
requirements for that job are (optionally) specified by keyword arguments (memory, cores, disk).

The :class:`toil.job.Job.Runner` class handles the invocation of Toil workflows. 
It is fed an options object that configures the running of the workflow. 
This can be populated by an argument parser object using 
:func:`toil.job.Job.Runner.getDefaultArgumentParser`, allowing all these options to be specified 
via the command line to the script. See :ref:`tutorial-ref` for more details.

Building & Testing
------------------

For developers and people interested in building the project from source the following
explains how to setup virtualenv to create an environment to use Toil in. 

After cloning the source and ``cd``-ing into the project root, create a virtualenv and activate it::

    virtualenv venv
    . venv/bin/activate

Simply running

::

   make

from the project root will print a description of the available Makefile
targets.

If cloning from GitHub, running

::

   make develop

will install Toil in *editable* mode, also known as `development mode`_. Just
like with a regular install, you may specify extras to use in development mode
after installing any native dependencies listed in :ref:`installation-ref`.

::

   make develop extras=[aws,mesos,azure,encryption]

.. _development mode: https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#development-mode

To invoke the tests (unit and integration) use

::

   make test

Run an individual test with

::

   make test tests=src/toil/test/sort/sortTest.py::SortTest::testSort

The default value for ``tests`` is ``"src"`` which includes all tests in the
``src`` subdirectory of the project root. Tests that require a particular
feature will be skipped implicitly. If you want to explicitly skip tests that
depend on a currently installed *feature*, use

::

   make test tests="-m 'not azure' src"

This will run only the tests that don't depend on the ``azure`` extra, even if
that extra is currently installed. Note the distinction between the terms
*feature* and *extra*. Every extra is a feature but there are features that are
not extras, the ``gridengine`` and ``parasol`` features fall into that
category. So in order to skip tests involving both the Parasol feature and the
Azure extra, the following can be used::

   make test tests="-m 'not azure and not parasol' src"

Running Mesos Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :ref:`Apache Mesos <mesos>`. Be sure to create the virtualenv with
``--system-site-packages`` to include the Mesos Python bindings. Verify by
activating the virtualenv and running .. ``pip list | grep mesos``. On OS X,
this may come up empty. To fix it, run the following::

    for i in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/*mesos*; do ln -snf $i venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ ; done
